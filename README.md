# Student Performance Prediction using Regression Models

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores factors that influence student academic performance and applies regression techniques to predict outcomes. Using a dataset of demographic, social, and academic features, the analysis identifies key drivers of success while evaluating multiple regression models for predictive accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **pandas, NumPy** – data cleaning, manipulation, preprocessing
* **matplotlib, seaborn** – data visualization and EDA
* **scikit-learn** – regression models, feature scaling, model evaluation
* **statsmodels** – statistical modeling (OLS)
* **scipy.stats** – distribution analysis
* **itertools** – hyperparameter combinations

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaned missing values, standardized features, and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualized distributions, correlations, and key performance drivers.
3. **Modeling** – applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDRegressor).
4. **Evaluation** – compared models using R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Insights** – identified significant factors such as parental education, prior grades, and study preparation.

## 🚀 Results

* Regression models successfully predicted student performance with reasonable accuracy.
* Analysis highlighted **demographic and behavioral variables** as strong indicators of outcomes.
* Provided actionable insights that could support academic interventions.
